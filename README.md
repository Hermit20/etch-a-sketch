# etch-a-sketch

Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project is part of The Odin Project’s Foundations Course, focusing on DOM manipulation, events, Flexbox layout, and dynamic rendering with JavaScript. The goal is to build an interactive “Etch-a-Sketch” webpage where users can draw by hovering their mouse over a grid of squares.

🚀 Project Overview

Users begin with a 16×16 grid of square divs generated entirely through JavaScript. As the mouse hovers over each square, it changes color—creating a pixelated drawing effect.

A button allows the user to create a brand-new grid of any size (up to 100×100). When a new value is entered, the previous grid is cleared and replaced with a resized version that fits inside the same container space.

Optional enhancements include:

Randomizing the RGB color on hover

Gradually darkening squares by 10% with each pass (reaching full opacity after 10 interactions)

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have gained experience with:

JavaScript

DOM selection and manipulation

Event listeners for mouse interactions

Using prompts and handling user input

Basic logic for color manipulation and progressive opacity

HTML & CSS

Structuring content with container elements

Styling with Flexbox to create a responsive grid layout

Managing layout issues related to borders, margins, and sizing

Applying hover effects and dynamic class changes

Developer Workflow

Using browser developer tools to debug DOM and console errors

Writing meaningful commit messages and pushing to GitHub

Iterating through a project “early and often”
